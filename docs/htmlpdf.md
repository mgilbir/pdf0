# HTML and CSS to PDF

Three inputs — a document, a stylesheet, a sheet of paper — and a PDF.

```go
out, err := htmlpdf.Render(htmlpdf.Input{
    HTML: document,
    CSS:  []htmlpdf.Stylesheet{{Source: stylesheet}},
}, htmlpdf.Options{Page: htmlpdf.A5})

// Worth reading whether or not a document came of it.
for _, f := range out.Findings {
    log.Printf("%s: %s", f.Rule, f.Message)
}
if err != nil {
    return err
}
return out.Document.Write(w)
```

`examples/html_to_pdf` is that call with a real invoice around it, and CI runs
it on every push.

## Where the work happens

The layout engine is not in this repository. The HTML parser, the CSS syntax
and cascade, the box model, floats, tables, line breaking and the bidirectional
algorithm are [forme](https://github.com/mgilbir/forme), which has no idea what
a PDF is. What is here is the backend: `htmlpdf/pdfout.go`, which writes a
display list into a document.

```
forme/html     ─┐
forme/css      ─┤
forme/style    ─┼─▶ forme/layout ─▶ Compose ─▶ []layout.Op ─▶ htmlpdf.Render ─▶ *pdf0.Document
forme/shape    ─┤                  (build, lay out,          (writePage)
forme/bidi     ─┤                   scale, check, paint)
forme/segment  ─┘
```

`layout.Compose` stops one step short of a document, and that step is the only
one that knows what a document is. A caller who wants the display list rather
than a PDF — to draw onto a canvas, to test, to write some other format — calls
`Compose` directly and never imports this package.

## The API

`htmlpdf` re-exports the handful of names the call above needs, so the common
case takes one import:

| name | is |
|---|---|
| `Input`, `Stylesheet` | the document and its stylesheets |
| `Options`, `PageSize`, `PageSizePt` | the sheet and the refusal thresholds |
| `A4`, `A5`, `Letter` | named sheets, each with a margin already |
| `Finding`, `Size` | what `Result` carries |

`Result` and `RefusedError` are this package's own, since what a render produced
and why it would not are its business rather than the engine's.

They are **aliases**, not wrappers, so they are the same types
`github.com/mgilbir/forme/layout` declares. A caller who outgrows the list — a
resource resolver for images, a font library, a severity policy, the display
list itself — imports `layout` and finds every value already fits. See
`htmlpdf/api.go`.

## One way it can fail

`Render` returns a `Result` and an error, and **the error is non-nil exactly
when `Result.Document` is nil**. There is no state where one says yes and the
other no, so the ordinary shape works and cannot go wrong:

```go
out, err := htmlpdf.Render(in, opts)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
return out.Document.Write(w)
```

Two things can go wrong, and a caller who cares which asks:

```go
var refused *htmlpdf.RefusedError
switch {
case errors.As(err, &refused):
    // The document is wrong: it would only have fitted illegibly, or a face
    // has no glyph for a character on the page. refused.Findings says how.
case err != nil:
    // Writing failed: a full disk, a broken io.Writer.
}
```

The thresholds behind a refusal are `Options.MinScale` and
`Options.MinFontSizePt`, both with defaults, and `Input.Policy` can lower any
rule's severity if a warning is what you want instead.

> **This shape changed.** A refused document used to come back as a nil
> `Document` with a **nil error**, on the reasoning that "this needs a
> three-point font to fit, so I have not made one" is not an I/O failure. The
> reasoning is sound and the shape it produced was not: the second check is not
> where anyone looks, and a caller who wrote the five lines above got a nil
> dereference. A refusal is an error now.

## Findings

Everything the engine could not do is reported rather than guessed at. A
property it does not implement, a character the face has no glyph for, an image
it was not allowed to load, content that ran off the sheet. `Finding` carries
the rule, a message, a severity, and where in the source it happened.

Two are worth knowing before you meet them:

- **`glyph-missing`** fires at error severity. The fourteen standard PDF faces
  cover WinAnsi and nothing else, so a document with a non-breaking hyphen or a
  Greek letter in it will be refused until you supply a face that has the
  character (`Input.Fonts`) — the alternative is a page silently missing a
  character, and text extraction that silently disagrees with the page.
- **`min-scale`** and **`min-font-size`** are the "made to fit but illegible"
  guards described above.

## Fonts

A `nil` `Input.Fonts` means the fourteen standard faces, which every PDF reader
is required to have and none of which is embedded. That keeps a document small
and is enough for Latin text. For anything else, or to embed, build a font set
and put the faces in it; `@font-face` in the document's own CSS is layered over
whatever the caller supplied.

## Scale to fit

Content wider or taller than the sheet is scaled down rather than cropped, and
`Result.Scale` says by how much. `Result.NaturalSize` is what it wanted before
scaling, which is the number to look at when adjusting a template.
`Options.AllowScaleUp` lets an underfull page be enlarged; it is off by
default, because it is surprising and it degrades images.

## How it is known to work

The layout engine's oracle is the W3C Web Platform Tests, run in forme: **4,438
of 5,177 CSS reftests pass cleanly**, and the number is a ratchet that a change
may not lower. That is a measurement of the engine, not of this backend.

What is checked here is the seam — that the two ends still meet:

- `TestHTMLAndCSSAndAPageSizeMakeAPDF` renders the three inputs, reads the
  document back, and asserts the page size in points, the text in reading
  order, and the stylesheet's effect on that document's own content stream.
- `htmlpdf/api_test.go` is an external test package importing only
  `pdf0/htmlpdf`, so a name missing from the alias list stops it compiling. It
  also pins the error shape: that a refusal is a `*RefusedError` carrying its
  findings, that the error and the document never disagree, and that checking
  only the error is enough — the last of which panicked under the old shape.
- CI runs `examples/html_to_pdf` and requires a PDF out of it.
